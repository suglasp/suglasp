Sharing some code or code samples I use in daily work, but also projects I realise in my spare time.

In the past (beginning of the 2000's), I used to create small games based on OpenGL/FMODex and Delphi.\
Later on, learend to program in Assembly, Shell, Basic, VB.NET, C#, Bash and Go lang.\
But today my interests point more towards scripting, system utilities and automation.\
I like utilities that are compact or self-contained.\
Therefore, I like diving into reversing code or file formats, operating system internals, backend services and game dev related stuff.\
These are on the top of my interests list.
